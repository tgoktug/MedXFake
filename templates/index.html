<h1>MedXFake</h1>
<h2>A New, Comprehensive, Realistic and Applicable Deep-Fake Synthesis, Manipulation and Detection System for Medical Images</h2>

        <p>
            Accessing the outputs of medical imaging applications is costly and challenging due to factors such as
            protecting patient rights and confidentiality of personal data. Image synthesis methods developed to solve
            these problems are dangerous in terms of medical data security.
            <br><br>
            In this study, deepfake images were generated using DDPM and GAN models on medical images collected from
            online platforms. A realistic medical image manipulation pipeline was built using a DDPM-based method.
            Furthermore, a large medical deepfake dataset was created, and different learning strategies were
            implemented for deepfake detection.
            <br><br>
            Fake images synthesized from scratch were detected using a ResNet-based classifier, achieving an
            F1-score of <b>99.783%</b>. Detecting manipulated images is more challenging; therefore, a contrastive
            learning–based fine-tuning stage was applied, boosting CNN detection accuracy from <b>89.9%</b> to <b>98%</b>.
            <br><br>
            All synthesis, manipulation, and detection modules were integrated into a unified API system, and a user-friendly
            web application was developed to bring high-performance medical deepfake generation and detection capabilities
            to the end user.
